# App Title: LenditLocal

Welcome to the LenditLocal App, where users can give away or lend their items or goods to their neighbours. Features extend to CRUD operations, a user's personal help count, photo upload, requests to borrow or retreieve the goods, and search functionality. Users are able to see all listings within their neighbourhood and can see all their personal listings and transactions made or ongoing. Users can also edit their profile information as well as listings. If a user wants to borrow or retrieve a certain item being listed, they would have to submit a request first and wait for the response of the user they are requesting from. Only then if the other user is willing to accept their request, is a completed transaction achieved.
